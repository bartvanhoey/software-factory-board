# Install from Docker Hub

No source code or build needed: you only need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and two files.

1. Make a folder and download `docker-compose.release.yml` and `.env.example` into it:

   ```bash
   mkdir software-factory && cd software-factory
   curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartvanhoey/software-factory-board/main/docker-compose.release.yml
   curl -fsSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartvanhoey/software-factory-board/main/.env.example
   ```

2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the same folder and fill in the variables, as described in step 2 of [Getting Started](../README.md#getting-started). Optionally add `FACTORY_VERSION=1.0.0` to pin a version (default: `latest`).

3. Start it:

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose.release.yml up -d
   ```

   Run every later `docker compose` command with the same `-f docker-compose.release.yml`, from this same folder.

4. Open <http://localhost:2999> and continue with steps 4 and 5 of [Getting Started](../README.md#getting-started). The release setup has no `projects/` folder, so add your repositories on the **Projects** screen.

## Publishing a release (maintainers)

Add the repository secrets `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` and `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN` (a Docker Hub access token with Read & Write), then push a version tag. The [Release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml) builds the image for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` and pushes it as `<username>/software-factory-board:1.2.3`, `:1.2` and `:latest`.

```bash
git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0
```

The image name in `docker-compose.release.yml` must match your Docker Hub username.

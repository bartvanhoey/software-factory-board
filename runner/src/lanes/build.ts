 *   branch and gives the agent the feedback. Reworks are picked first. Automatic picks stop at
 *   `limits.maxReworks` rounds and at a `[build]` comment newer than the feedback (a failed rework);
 *   `--issue` ignores both. Stale feedback (the branch moved since) is never reworked.
 *
 * Either way the result is verified independently, the branch is pushed (never forced) and the card
 * moves to `qa`. No PR is opened: a PR means "approved", and only the review lane opens one.
 * On a failure after the pick the card stays in `building` with a comment on the issue.

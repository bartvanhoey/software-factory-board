Commands:
  reset-mfa        Remove the user's MFA (authenticator and recovery codes) and end their sessions.
                   Works on administrators. They set MFA up again at next login if it is required.
  reset-password   Set a temporary password (shown once) that must be changed at next login, and end
                   their sessions. Does not touch MFA: run reset-mfa as well if both are lost.

Options:
  --email <email>  The account (must exist).
  --reason <text>  Why, one line, up to 200 characters. Recorded in the audit log.
  --help           Show this text (as the first argument).

Exit codes: 0 done (or nothing to do), 1 refused (unknown account, unusable reason), 64 usage, 69 database or environment.`;
